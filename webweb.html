     <hr>
     <p style="text-align: center;">[Verse 1]<br> My idea of a perfect Christmas<br> Is to spend it with you In a party or dinner for two<br> Anywhere would do<br> Celebrating the yuletide season Always lights up our lives<br> Simple pleasures are made special too<br>When they're shared with you <br>[Verse 2]<br>Looking through some old photographs<br>Faces and friends, we'll always remember<br>Watching busy shoppers rushing about<br>In the cool breeze of December<br>Sparkling lights, all over town<br>Children's carols in the air<br>By the Christmas tree<br>A shower of stardust on your hair<br>[Chorus]<br>I can't think of a better Christmas<br>Than my wish coming true<br>And my wish is you'd let me spend<br>My whole life with you<br>[Verse 3]<br>Looking through some old photographs<br>Faces and friends, we'll always remember<br>Watching busy shoppers rushing about<br>In the cool breeze of December<br>Sparkling lights, all over town<br>Children's carols in the air<br>By the Christmas tree<br>A shower of stardust on your hair<br>[Chorus]<br>I can't think of a better Christmas<br>Than my wish coming true<br>And my wish is you'd let me spend<br>My whole life with you<br>[Outro]<br>My idea of a perfect Christmas<br>Is spending it with you<br>
